For this module assignment, I was tasked with plotting Earthquake data onto a map using Javascript, CSS and HTML. With the help of the week 15 day 3 activity number 5, I was able to create my map and plotted the data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. I also used https://codepen.io/haakseth/pen/KQbjdO to help add the legend in CSS and Javascript. Overall, this was a fun exercise that I believe helped expand on my front end skills. I was unfamiliar with the amount of earthquakes in the Alaskan region and this assignment peaked my interest into this phenomenon.
